## Previous Buffer

This is a neovim plugin which helps you to quickly jump back to the previous buffer which you had opened.
Unfortuntely neovim doesn't have this by default so i had to code this one up.

## Usage

use the command PreviousBuffer to jump back to the previous buffer.

you should probably bind a key to this command.
